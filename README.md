# Java-Practice-Questions
This repository consists of theory and programming questions I solved during Java course by Rahul Mathakari Sir.

************************************************
### Assignment 1 | Theory

1. What are command line arguments and explain the working of them?
2. How to convert a numeric string into an integer?
3. Explain working of all parse methods?
4. Explain Scanner class and all its nextXXX() methods?
5. Why nextChar() method is not available in class Scanner?
6. What are packages in java?
7. Explain Benefits of packages over header files?
8. Explain Number FormatException and the situation when it will arise?
9. Explain Input Mismatch Exception and the situation when it will arise?
10. Explain ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException and the situation when it will arise?

### Assignment 1 | Practicle

1. Find the absolute value of any number using ternary operator. Example absolute value of -10 is 10 and absolute value of 20 is 20 only.
2. Find the smallest number between three numbers using nested ternary
operator.
3. Accept three sides of triangle in any order that is user can give three
sides as 3 4 5 or 4 5 3 or 3 5 4 in all situations you have to check that
given input can form a right-angled triangle or not. If given input can
form Right angled triangle print 1 else print -1.

4. Accept 5 subject marks using command line argument and if, in all
subject student secure more than or equal to 35 marks add all subject
marks and find percentage and print it. If student is failed in one or more
subject print failed along with subject number/numbers.
Example: 78 34 89 64 21
Output: Failed 2 5

5. Accept a two digits number from command line argument like 01 or 02
or 11 or 99 and suppose these are the years like 1901,1902, 1911 and
1999 now find the accepted year is leap year or not.

### Assignment 2 |

1. WAP to accept 2 numbers and a symbol in string format now according
to symbol perform the operation and display the result. Now ask user do
you want to continue if user enters true continue the process and again
accept two numbers and a symbol perform the operation and display
the result. If user enters false terminate the process.

2. WAP to accept two numbers where n1>n2 or n2>n1 both allowed but
n1==n2 not allowed your task is to find all the numbers between n1 and
n2 (including n1 and n2) that are divisible by 3 and 5 both numbers. And
output should be get printed in increasing order of numbers.
Example: n1=30, n2=10 numbers between n1 and n2 that are divisible by
3 and 5 both are 15 and 30 only so print 15 30 in output (in increasing
order).

3. WAP to accept two numbers n1 and n2 from the user and print all the
prime number available between n1 and n2 in decreasing order.
Example: n1=10 n2=20, available prime numbers between the range is
19 17 13 11 (print in decreasing order)

4. WAP to accept n where 1<=n<=4 digit number and check whether it is
Armstrong number or not.

5. WAP to accept three numbers n1 n2 and p from the user and find the
even numbers between the n1 and n2 (including n1 and n2) now your
task is to only print all the pth even number found between n1 and n2.
Example: n1 =2 n2=20 p=3
All even numbers between n1 and n2 are 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20
Here p=3 so print every third even number from the sequence so output
will be 6 12 18.

6. WAP to find the kth digit of a accepted numbers. So accept two numbers
In and k where k denotes place of digit that has to display.
Example n=56789 and k=2 so from right to left 8 is the second digit so
print 8 in output.
If k is greater than number of digits available in n print message kth digit
not found.
Example: n=56789 n=10 so print message 10th digit not found.

### Assignment 3 |

1. WAP to accept an integer n from user and create array of size n. now
accept n values in array by user. Values can be duplicate. Now find the
most repeated element in array. if all elements are with frequency 1
print the message "all element has same frequency"

2. WAP to accept an integer n from user and create array of size n. now
accept n values in array by user. Values can be duplicate. now reverse
the elements of array. Do not create another array.
Note: Do not print array in reverse manipulate the array itself such that
elements of array get stored in reverse order in same array.

3. WAP to accept an integer n from user and create array of size n. now
accept n values in array by user. Now find the sum of all even terms and
all odd terms available in array. finally print the sum of both in output.

4. WAP to accept an integer n from user and create array of size n. now
accept n values in array by user. Now find how many prime numbers are
available in array.

5. WAP to accept an integer n from user and create array of size n. now
accept n values in array by user. Now find how many Fibonacci terms are
available in array. Fibonacci term are those numbers which are available
in Fibonacci series for example 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13..... so these all terms are
Fibonacci terms.
